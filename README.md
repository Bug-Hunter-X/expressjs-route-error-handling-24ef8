# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling within route handlers that interact with databases.

The `bug.js` file showcases a route that fetches user data from a database.  It lacks proper error handling, leading to generic error messages being sent to the client.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that includes comprehensive error handling, ensuring better user experience and improved debugging capabilities.
